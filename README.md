# Description:
The ExcelXmlPacket Utility is a collection of functions designed to interact with Excel files stored in XML format. It provides various functionalities to read data from Excel sheets, manipulate the data, and extract specific information such as sheet names, cell values, last used columns, and more.

# Features:

1.) Reading Excel Data: The utility can read data from Excel sheets stored in XML format.

2.) Sheet Information: It provides functions to retrieve information about the sheets present in the Excel file, such as names of the sheets.

3.) Cell Value Extraction: Users can extract the value of a specific cell by providing its address.

4.) Last Used Column: The utility determines the index of the last used column in a sheet.

5.) Error Handling: Proper error handling is implemented to ensure smooth execution and error reporting.


# Purpose: 
This code can be wrapped as an object or library in any RPA technology, hence providing us with methods to manage and interact with an Excel file as XML. This prevents the time wasted waiting for Excel to open up and performing traditional Excel VBO.
The Global Code contains a VB.Net  class named ExcelXmlPacket is designed to process Excel files. It takes the path to an Excel file as input and extracts information from it. The class creates a copy of the Excel file with a .zip extension and extracts its contents. Then, it reads data from the extracted XML files like worksheets and shared strings. Finally, it stores the extracted data in a structured format for further processing.


Overall, the ExcelXmlPacket Utility streamlines the process of working with Excel files in XML format, providing developers with essential functions for data extraction and manipulation.
